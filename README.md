# ‚ö° Fault Detection in Electrical Power Transmission Lines

## üìå Project Overview  
Electrical power transmission lines are a **critical component** of power systems, ensuring the delivery of electricity from generation plants to distribution networks. However, these lines are susceptible to **various faults**, which can impact the **stability, reliability, and safety** of power distribution.  

This project aims to implement a **fault detection system** using **machine learning models** to classify faults efficiently and enhance power system resilience.

## üîç **Problem Statement**  
Faults in transmission lines can lead to:  
- **Power losses** due to increased resistance.  
- **Short circuits** caused by insulation breakdown.  
- **Safety hazards** and **financial losses** for utility companies.  

Timely and accurate fault detection is **essential** to ensure **quick intervention and prevent larger system failures**.

## **Machine Learning Approach**  
This project compares **two machine learning models** for binary classification of faults:  
1. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**  
2. **Random Forests (RF)**  

By analyzing these models, we aim to:  
‚úÖ Identify which model performs best in detecting transmission line faults.  
‚úÖ Evaluate **accuracy, reliability, and efficiency** in classification.  
‚úÖ Improve the **robustness of power system protection mechanisms**.
